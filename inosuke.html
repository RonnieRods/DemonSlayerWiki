                 is one of the main characters of <i>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba </i> and along with

            <h2>
                <span>Appearance</span>
            </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Inosuke is a young man of average height and pale complexion with an extremely toned and muscular 
                build for his age. In sharp contrast to this, he has an incredibly pretty and feminine face, with large, 
                wide eyes that are framed by an array of long eyelashes, their iris a dark to soft pale green, thin 
                eyebrows, and what could be a small, well-mannered mouth. His thick, black hair reaches just past 
                his shoulders, fading into blue at the tips and forming an unruly an uneven fringe that falls 
                just above his eyes, puffing out before curving and thinning towards his forehead.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Inosuke, in his unique fashion, has customized his Demon Slayer uniform to suit his personal style. His 
                altered atture consists of baggy hakama pants in a dark gray-blue shade, secured at his hips with a thick 
                belt adorned with fluffy brown deer fur. Unlike his fellow companions, Inosuke forgoes wearing a haori. 
                Instead of the customary leg wraps, he opts for knee-high socks made from bear hide, which serve as a 
                base for the sandals he wears. Notably, his heels and toes are left exposed. However, the most 
                distinctive aspect of his appearance is the gray, hollowed-out boar's head that he wears as a mask.
                Inosuke has modified the boar's head, altering the eyes to allow him to see while wearing it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                <span>Personality</span>
            </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Inosuke is a short-tempered, confrontational, abrasive, and proud. He always likes to think he is the 
                strongest fighter in a situation, constantly challenging most people he comes across and wanting 
                others to respect and praise him for his skill. This often leads him into unnecessary danger since 
                he tends to overestimate his abilities in comparison to who he's fighting and refuses to accept when 
                he's been defeated, which can be seen when Giyu Tomioka has to tie him up after his fight with the 
                Father to prevent him challenging the Hashira to a fight while still severly injured from his 
                previous battle. This constant wanting to be the best can also cause Inosuke to be very provacative, 
                as he often tries to goad others, most prominently Tanjiro Kamado, into fighting him, although 
                in the case of the latter he usually fails due to Tanjiro's obliviously kind nature.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Inosuke possesses a rather vengeful side to his personality, especially when the people he cares 
                about get harmed. He refused to help the injured Train Engineer who stabbed Tanjiro and was convinced 
                he was right in letting him die, only helping him when Tanjiro begged Inosuke to do so and forgave 
                the man. He immediately attacked Doma upon learning he killed and devoured Shinobu, and he became 
                truly angered when he found out Doma was also the one who orphaned him, challenging the Upper Moon 
                by himself and declaring he would create hell for him. Most notably, he challenged Muzan directly 
                and demanded he atone himself by dying for mutilating and nearly killing all the other Demon Slayers.
