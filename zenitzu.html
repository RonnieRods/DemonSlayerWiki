                yellow hair of varying lengths, cutting off sqaurely at the ends where it fades to a darker orange color, that falls
                in front of his face in uneven bangs, loosely resembling a bowl cut. Before he became a Demon Slayer, Zenitsu's
                hair was originally black, but it turned the color it is currently when he was struck by lightning during his training.

            <p>
                For some time following the battle at <a href="mount_natagumo.html" class="link">Mount Natagumo</a>, his limbs
                temporarily shrank to <a href="son.html" class="link">Son</a>'s poison but were able to return to normal afterward
                thanks to medicine he had taken developed by <a href="shinobu.html" class="link">Shinobu Kocho</a>.

                He wears a paler brown version of the standard Demon Slayer uniform, which consist of a dark brown button-up 
                jacket, a white belt around his waist, and tattsuke hakama pants that extend, as well as his signnature

                Zenitsu is cowardly, nihilistic, weak-willed, and anxious, often claiming that he doesn't have long to live due to
                the dangerous job of being a Demon Slayer. He has rather low self-esteem despite his talent and strength, even
                considering himself useless. This was evident when he couldn't believe he had slain a demon and tricked himself into
                instead believing that it was <a href="shoichi.html" class="link">Shoichi</a>, even though the latter was a young
                child who didn't possess any form of skill. Zenitsu is in a constant state of fear, and he frequently tries to run
                away at the sight of danger, claiming he wants to live a modest, normal life instead of that of a Demon Slayer.
                Due to this, Zenitsu screams and shouts a lot, much to the annoyance of the people around him. He is also shown to
                be pessimistic at times, especially during <a href="hashira_training.html" class="link">Hashira Training</a>, where
                he lashed out at Tanjiro and Inosuke for viewing the training positively.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In spite of his weaknesses, Zenitsu desires to live up to the expectations others have set for him and will try his
                hardest when he needs to. He holds great respect and admiration for his comrades and his deceased teacher,
                <a href="jigoro.html" class="link">Jigoro Kuwajima</a>, and his inner focus and drive to avenge him help to wash
                away his cowardice and second thoughts when he is in a pinch. Zenitsu also hates himself for how cowardly and
                incompetent he is, despite genuinely striving to better himself.

                </figure>
                Zenitsu is also shown to be something of a wannabe womanizer, stemming from a desire to not be single should he be
                killed. He tends to hit on girls who he thinks are cute and asks them to marry him, much to their annoyance. This
                womanizing nature is shown to override his docile and quiet personality, particularly when he believes his comrades
                are "flirting" with cute girls; he would snap and go on long hysterical rants and complaints. Zenitsu is shown to
                have a strong attraction to <a href="nezuko.html" class="link">Nezuko</a>, openly expressing his affection for her
                and always rushing to protect her as if on instinct. During these times, he is also shown to become physically
                aggressive, lashing out at people in frustration. Though, despite his shallow behaviour in this regard, Zenitsu does
                show respect for woman, telling <a href="daki.html" class="link">Daki</a> to let go of a girl that Daki nearly tore
                the ear off of and later demanding that she apologize, showing no fear at all in front of the enraged Upper Rank demon.

            <br>
            <p>
                In spite of his cowardly demeanour and somewhat pathetic attempts to gain the attention of women, he has shown
                level-headedness on rare occasions, becoming annoyed by his comrades' shenanigans, such as Tanjiro's kind naivety,
                Inosuke's bombastic personality, Kyojuro's boisterous and loud character, and Tengen's self-glorifying proclamations.
                As such, he typically squabbles with Inosukewhen the latter goes on with his loud demands and boasts. Additionally,
                as the only one to have grown up in the city, Zenitsu is the most street-smart of the trio, being the most familiar
                with urban environments and Japan's industrialization. As such, he became frustrated with his partners' lack of
                understanding, namely Tanjiro and Inosuke's inability to recognize a train.

                Before the battle in the <a href="infinity_castle.html" class="link">Infinity Castle</a>, Zenitsu gives off a different,
                more serious impression, as if he is focused on something important, even disregarding Tanjiro's worries for him as
                he claims there is something he must do by himself. This development occurred after receiving a letter from
                <a href="chuntaro.html" class="link">Chuntaro</a>, which revealed his master's death and Kaigaku's role behind it.
                During his fight against Kaigaku, Zenitsu is stern and becomes enraged, causing him to angrily yell at him for
                disrespecting their cultivator. His sudden change surprises his former senior, as Zenitsu shows a more mature persona
                compared to his usual cowardice.

                </figure>
                From the beginning, Zenitsu comes off as a talented and skilled Demon Slayer, though he denies this. His strength
                awakens when he is asleep, as his nervous demeanour is what normally keeps him from accessing his abilities,
                making him more sagacious, calm, and precise in combat. This allowed him to instantly decapitate the
                <a href="tongue_demon.html" class="link">Tongue Demon</a> and defeat the <a href="son.html" class="link">Son</a>
                of the Spider Family by himself. He was later able to defend three entire train carts being attacked by
                <a href="enmu.html" class="link">Enmu</a>, Lower Rank One, along with Nezuko. A few months after that, he was
                able to go toe-to-toe with an awakened <a href="daki.html" class="link">Daki</a> with the assistance of
                <a href="inosuke copy.html" class="link">Inosuke</a>, and later managed to blitz her with
                <b>Thunderclap and Flash: Godspeed</b>. As further credence to his strength, Zenitsu was able to advance
                to the highest point of the <a href="hashira_training.html" class="link">Hashira Training</a>.

                </figure>
                However, the greatest extent of his powers manifests when Zenitsu fights while awake, as he managed to outmatch
                the new Upper Rank Six, <a href="kaigaku.html" class="link">Kaigaku</a>, in speed by himself and was later blitzed
                and decapitated before he could react, although he sustained several severe injuries. Moreover, Zenitsu's initial
                reluctance to kill Kaigaku, someone he once cared about and looked up to, was the only thing that gave the Upper
                Rank the initial advantage, hinting that he could have simply killed him from the beginning if he so desired.
                Later on, he could keep up with and battle the Demon King, <a href="muzan.html" class="link">Muzan Kibutsuji</a>,
                albeit while severely weakened by the Anti-Kibutsuji Drug. Nonetheless, Zenitsu's strength more than likely
                matched that of the Hashira by the end of the series.

                </figure>
                <strong>Indomitable Will:</strong> In spite of his initial cowardice and reluctance to fight, Zenitsu nonetheless
                possesses indomitable willpower and spirit. This was displayed when he absolutely refused to let
                <a href="inosuke copy.html" class="link">Inosuke</a> kill the demon inside
                <a href="tanjiro.html" class="link">Tanjiro</a>'s box and protected it to the end despite getting relentlessly
                beat up by Inosuke. While he was asleep, during the battle against Daki, Zenitsu had the willpower to continue
                fightig despite sustaining numerous slash wounds all over his body and having his feet broken. Through sheer
                will and anger, Zenitsu was able to overcome his cowardice and stay awake in battle against demons, as shown
                during his bout with Kaigaku and Muzan, especially in the fight with the latter, in which he refused to give
                up and persisted despite being eneravted and injured.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Tactical Intellect:</strong> Even when fighting unconscious, Zenitsu has displayed incredible judgement
                and tactical intellect. When fighting consciously, this ability is fully released. This ability was best
                exhibited during his battle against Upper Rank Six, <a href="daki.html" class="link">Daki</a>. When
                <a href="inosuke copy.html" class="link">Inosuke</a> made an erroneous deduction about her weaknesses.
                Zenitsu correctly explained that all they needed to do was keep both demons' heads disconnected to kill
                them. After his bout with <a href="kaigaku.html" class="link">Kaigaku</a> commenced, he was able to
                clearly think and process his techniques and demonic abilities.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Unconscious Combat:</strong> Zenitsu has the ability to fight when he sleeps, which allows him
                to awaken his true strength. While awake, his nerves and fear cause him to freeze up, so he cannot move.
                When his life is in danger, his nerves and fear grow so strong that he passes out. But while asleep, his
                nerves are no longer holding him back, allowing him to fight and move with great judgement, precision,
                and skill. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Physical Abilities</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Enhanced Strength:</b> Zenitsu has attained amazing physical strength through years of harsh training.
                Zenitsu can hold down <a href="inosuke copy.html" class="link">Inosuke Hashibira</a> with his bare hands
                and throw his entire body by grabbing and swinging one of his legs. Most importantly, Zenitsu has incredible
                leg strength, allowing him to jump extremely high and move at blistering speeds to perform his
                <a href="thunder_breathing.html" class="link">Thunder Breathing</a> techniques. He was also able to damage
                the body of Muzan, whose body has the highest durability out of all the demons, further testifying to his
                incredible physical strength.

                </figure>
                <b>Immense Speed & Reflexes:</b> Zenitsu is extremely fast, being able to easily move faster than even the
                eye can see. Even during the beginning of his career as a Demon Slayer, it is plainly obvious that his speed
                far outclassed that of lesser demons such as the <a href="tongue_demon.html" class="link">Tongue Demon</a>
                and <a href="son.html" class="link">Son</a> of the Spider Family. During both skirmishes, neither demon was
                able to hit Zenitsu when he was actively engaged in the battle, and both were completely unable to react to
                the speed of his attacks. During the battle against Enmu, he was able to save
                <a href="nezuko.html" class="link">Nezuko</a> from Lower Rank One's flesh appendages and could slice through
                many of them before Enmu could react.
                <br><br>
                As he progresses, his speed has improved to the point that his movements can't be perceived by Upper Rank
                demons like <a href="daki.html" class="link">Daki</a> and <a href="kaigaku.html" class="link">Kaigaku</a>,
                the former's reflexes having been amplified multiple times during the fight and the latter being a user of
                the same Breathing Style as Zenitsu. Moreover, Zenitsu could move faster than Kaigaku's lightning-based
                <a href="blood_demon_art.html" class="link">Blood Demon Art</a> and cut his neck before the attack reached
                him. Most impressively, Zenitsu could land multiple hits on the imperceptibly fast Demon King,
                <a href="muzan.html" class="link">Muzan Kibutsuji</a>, with his techniques, although he was severely weakened then.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Immense Stamina & Endurance:</strong> Zenitsu has incredible stamina and endurance. He has been shown
                to continue fighting even after being affected by lethal poison from the Son Spider Demon that was gradually
                weakening him and turning him into a spider. He was also able to defend three train cars with Nezuko for an
                extended period of time without tiring out. Later, Zenitsu, along with Inosuke, engaged in combat with Upper
                Rank Six, <a href="daki.html" class="link">Daki</a>, for an extended period of time. Even after receiving
                numerous wounds from the Upper Rank and later getting trapped under rubble, Zenitsu had enough stamina left

                <b>Enhanced Hearing:</b> Zenitsu possesses a heightened sense of hearing, allowing him to detect danger from
                even the faintest of sounds. With this, he has displayed the ability to decipher layers upon layers of sound
                in one of the brothels and even in the <a href="infinity_castle.html" class="link">Infinity Castle</a>. As
                another testament to his great sound detection ability, he can perfectly replicate any tune he hears on a
                shamisen and koto only after listening to it once for the first time, possessing perfect pitch despite
                having no musical background. Zenitsu's exceptional hearing also enables him to fight in his sleep, an
                impressive feat as he has no visual aid and can only use sound to discern his surroundings while keeping up
                with the attacks of demons.

                        can discern a human from a demon by comparing the sounds they make, which also allows him to determine

                <strong>Master Swordsman: </strong>Zenitsu is an incredibly talented swordsman, displaying highly refined
                proficiency in extremely fast Iaijutsu-like swordsmanship and the <b>Thunderclap and Flash</b> technique, to the
                point where he can create offshoots of the technique and utilize it even while he is asleep. His swordsmanship
                skill allowed him to fend off dozens of spiders and defend three train carts that Enmu was constantly attacking.
                Zenitsu's sword-wielding skill evolved to the point that he could fight against Upper Rank demons of the
                <a href="twelve_kizuki.html" class="link">Twelve Kizuki</a> and later match a severely weakened Muzan, implying
                that his swordsmanship skill has most likely improved to the point that is matches that of the Hashira, the

                style and could only be able to use the first of the six forms in it, known as <b>Thunderclap and Flash</b>.
                However, Zenitsu has become incredibly proficient in fighting and winning using the first form alone, even
                creating several variations and modifications to it and being able to successfully perform the technique even
                while unconscious. Later, Zenitsu even created an entire new form in Thunder Breathing, something only a Hashira,

                    After the events of the story, Zenitsu wrote a 79 volume-long memoir entitle "<i>The Legend of Zenitsu</i>".
                    He began writing it after Tanjiro warned him to not overplay his leg injuries so that Nezuko would 
                    massage him out of pity. However, it was heavily exaggerated and filled with self-indulgent and escapist
                    ramblings. While his action-oriented stories were skillful, other chapters were outlandish, under-explained,
                    and confusing. "<i>The Legend of Zenitsu</i>" was also filled with heavy embellishments including:

                            Zenitsu also described himself as being an absurd 9 shaku in height (~9 feet) and drew a self portrait
                            inaccurately portraying him as having strong facial hair and an imposing, well-built figure.

                            Nezuko was a princess and later a plum tree spirit. Zenitsu described her in vivid detail, down to her
                            number of eyelashes, and accompanied his memoir with a highly detailed illustration of Nezuko.

                                    It would appear however, that at the end of a 25-part volume filled with nonsensical chapter titles,
                                    when Zenitsu presumablt grew older, he wrote an accurate passage entitled "<i>The Life of Happiness

                    Zenitsu created paintings of Nezuko that were so detailed and realistic they were like photographs. On several
                    occasions, he was asked to sell his paintingsm only to become so angry that he would tear the buttocks off his trousers.

                    Zenitsu is superstitious as he was shown to be delighted seeing two tea stalks in his tea in the extra chapters.

                    Zenitsu's hearing allowed him to hear the sickening remarks that girls made on him behind his back. This caused him
                    to be scared of girls so much that he couldn't stand it anymore (though his naturally cheery and persistent nature
                    allowed him to recover quickly).

                <li class="fixlist">
                    Though Zenitsu fell in love with Nezuko at first sight, he was skeptical of how Tanjiro described her. He couldn't
                    believe that girls could be so one-sidedly kind. When he saw how Nezuko wasn't two-faced and was truly kind, he became
                    so happy that he saw paradise for a moment and almost ascended to heaven.

                            This massive amount of debt likely came from his 7 ex-girlfriends. Despite all of them being beautiful, they treated
                            Zenitsu like a slave, tricked him as well as robbing him of his money. Zenitsu also never got to even
