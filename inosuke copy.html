                Inosuke is a young man of average height and pale complexion with an extremely toned and muscular 
                build for his age. In sharp contrast to this, he has an incredibly pretty and feminine face, with large, 
                wide eyes that are framed by an array of long eyelashes, their iris a dark to soft pale green, thin 
                eyebrows, and what could be a small, well-mannered mouth. His thick, black hair reaches just past 
                his shoulders, fading into blue at the tips and forming an unruly an uneven fringe that falls 
                just above his eyes, puffing out before curving and thinning towards his forehead.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Inosuke, in his unique fashion, has customized his Demon Slayer uniform to suit his personal style. His 
                altered atture consists of baggy hakama pants in a dark gray-blue shade, secured at his hips with a thick 
                belt adorned with fluffy brown deer fur. Unlike his fellow companions, Inosuke forgoes wearing a haori. 
                Instead of the customary leg wraps, he opts for knee-high socks made from bear hide, which serve as a 
                base for the sandals he wears. Notably, his heels and toes are left exposed. However, the most 
                distinctive aspect of his appearance is the gray, hollowed-out boar's head that he wears as a mask.
                Inosuke has modified the boar's head, altering the eyes to allow him to see while wearing it.

            <hr>
            <p>
                Inosuke is a short-tempered, confrontational, abrasive, and proud. He always likes to think he is the 
                strongest fighter in a situation, constantly challenging most people he comes across and wanting 
                others to respect and praise him for his skill. This often leads him into unnecessary danger since 
                he tends to overestimate his abilities in comparison to who he's fighting and refuses to accept when 
                he's been defeated, which can be seen when Giyu Tomioka has to tie him up after his fight with the 
                Father to prevent him challenging the Hashira to a fight while still severly injured from his 
                previous battle. This constant wanting to be the best can also cause Inosuke to be very provacative, 
                as he often tries to goad others, most prominently Tanjiro Kamado, into fighting him, although 
                in the case of the latter he usually fails due to Tanjiro's obliviously kind nature.

                </figure>
                Inosuke possesses a rather vengeful side to his personality, especially when the people he cares 
                about get harmed. He refused to help the injured Train Engineer who stabbed Tanjiro and was convinced 
                he was right in letting him die, only helping him when Tanjiro begged Inosuke to do so and forgave 
                the man. He immediately attacked Doma upon learning he killed and devoured Shinobu, and he became 
                truly angered when he found out Doma was also the one who orphaned him, challenging the Upper Moon 
                by himself and declaring he would create hell for him. Most notably, he challenged Muzan directly 
                and demanded he atone himself by dying for mutilating and nearly killing all the other Demon Slayers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Due to him having been raised by boars, Inosuke has also been shown to possess little understanding of 
                normal human interaction, at least at the time of his debut, as he seems to frequently assume that 
                people who approach him want to attack him and doesn't appear to understand the kindness others show 
                him. He can't read or write and struggles to say people's names correcctly, saying Monchiro instead of 
                Tanjiro or Monitsu instead of Zenitsu. He can be very rude, without intention, and treat everyone 
                as an enemy at first.

                </figure>
                However, as the story goes on, Inosuke is influenced more and more by Tanjiro's ways and becomes more 
                accustomed to affection and generosity, learning to also acknowledge the strength of people besides 
                himself and develop feelings of friendship towards him and Zenitsu Agatsuma, although he does still 
                retain his proud nature and constant desire for praise. He also begins to think more strategically 
                when engaging in combat, using smarter tactics he has picked up from more experienced Demon Slayers 
                and not just rushing into fights head-on without thinking. Inosuke's sense of camaraderie drastically 
                improves, best evidenced when he lunges at Muzan Kibutsuji while mourning the scores of Demon Slayers 
                killed and maimed by the Demon King and demanding he return everything he took from them or else die 
                as retribution for his crimes.

                Inosuke is a very skilled and talented swordsman, as he was able to learn Total Concentration Breathing 
                on his own, develop his very own Breathing Style known as Beast Breathing based on his own instincts 
                and upbringing in the mountains by wild boars, and pass Final Selection to become a Demon Slayer all 
                without formal training. Inosuke is more than capable of hunting and slaying demons on his own, as he 
                easily killed the Horned Demon without any trouble. He has shown on mulitple occasions to be able to 
                hold his own and contribute in fights against Upper Rank demons of the Twelve Kisuki, including 
                Upper Rank Six, Gyutaro and Daki, as well as the much stronger Upper Rank Two, Doma. He is also 
                incredibly gifted, possessing inhuman senses and superhuman flexibility, as well as a natural 
                aptitude for combat. Most impressively, Inosuke was able to fend off the Demon King, Muzan, along 
                with his fellow comrades, boasting the same combat proficiency as even the Hashira, te strongest 
                swordsman among all the Demon Slayers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Animal Imitation: </strong>Due to growing up with boars in the mountains, Inosuke adopted their 
                habits and started incorporating them into his fighting styles. As a result, both his hand-to-hand 
                combat style and swordsmanship style are very reminiscent of animals and beasts. Tanjiro Kamado noted 
                that his unnatural fighting style resembles that of a "four-legged beast" due to how his attacks come 
                from an extremely low angle while also being very ferocious and utilizing other unorthodox movements, 
                thus making him very unpredictable and vicious.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Indomitable Will: </strong>Inosuke possesses an incredible and undaunted will and spirit, 
                never faltering and remaining steadfast and courageous in the fact of any foe, to the point where 
                it endangers himself. His willpower was best displayed during his battle against Upper Rank Two, 
                Doma, where, despite sustaining dozens of injuries, he refused to give up and continued to fight 
                the demon despite his overwhelming power. Even in the face of the Demon King, Inosuke remained 
                steadfast and never gives up.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Poison Resistance: </strong>Inosuke was able to resist and survive the effect of Upper 
                Rank Six's poison to a certain extent, although it was considered incredibly deadly, which suggests 
                that he may have complete immunity to some poisonous substances. However, as stated by Aoi Kanzaki, 
                this also means that none of Shinobu Kocho's medicines will work on him, so if he is exposed to a 
                stronger poison than that of Gyutaro or one that he has not developed a resistance to, they cannot 
                be used as a remedy, and he is in greater danger of death.
            </p>

                </figure>
                <strong>Repetitive Action: </strong>A technique practiced by a few members of the Corps, it allows 
                a person to achieve the same effects as Total Concentration Breathing by using repeating pre-set 
                movements or remembering intense feelings to open the five senses and raise their concentration, 
                drawing out the physical powers of the body for a long, extended period of time. It is possible 
                to use both Repetitive Action and Total Concentration Breathing simultaneously, granting the user 
                immense strength to rival Upper Rank demons. Inosuke quickly mastered this technique after 
                watching Tanjiro, and he likes to rephrase "<i>Boar Rush!</i>" while doing so.

                <strong>Enhanced Flexibility: </strong>Inosuke is extremely flexible, to the point where he can bend 
                backwards so far that his head reaches between his feet. He later displays the ability to dislocate 
                his arm to extend his reach and dislocate any of the joints in his body at will. This flexibility 
                additionally extends to his internal organs, as he was able to shift his heart and avoid it being 
                pierced in the fight against Daki and Gyutaro.

                </figure>
                <strong>Immense Speed & Reflexes: </strong>Inosuke is an incredibly fast individual, as seen when 
                he was able to dodge Kyogai's numerous air slashes as they appear in time with his drum beats, 
                rush through the Tsuzumi Mansion at inhuman speeds, and managed to evade the Horned Demon's 
                attack in the nick of time and catch him by surprise, displaying his honed reflexes and speed. In 
                his duel against Tanjiro, he was able to dodge his attacks and quickly fight back, using both 
                hand-to-hand combat and his animalistic fighting style to overwhelm him. After training following 
                Kyojuro's death, his speed and reflexes have further improved, to the point he could fend off 
                Daki's sentient Obi sash while protecting the humans trapped inside them and later manage to go 
                toe-to-toe with the Upper Rank herself. With the help of Zenitsu and Tanjiro, Inosuke was able to 
                run up to Daki and decapitate her before she could react. As further credence to his superhuman 
                speed, Inosuke can keep up with Upper Rank Two, Doma, with varying degrees of success, sometimes 
                being able to land some hits on him and even steal Kanao's katana away from him without Doma 
                noticing despite the sword being next to him. Even though he was enervated and injured, Inosuke 
                could still match Muzan and later transformed Tanjiro in speed.

            <p>
                <strong>Immense Stamina & Endurance: </strong>Due to enduring harsh training as a Demon Slayer, Inosuke 
                has developed great endurance and stamina, which he displayed on multiple occasions. In his skirmish 
                with Tanjiro, he managed to fight on equal terms with him even with his ribs broken. In the mission 
                to Mount Natagumo, Inosuke managed to withstand several direct punches from Father in his transformed 
                state, who was already strong enough to easily smash boulders and shatter thick trees in his usual 
                form; he also survived having his head slowly crushed by him, Inosuke, along with Zenitsu, was 
                capable of keeping up with an awakened Daki and lasted long enough to cut off her head despite 
                suffering multiple injuries. Furthermore, Inosuke sill played a pivotal role in the Upper Rank's 
                defeat despite getting stabbed in the chest while being inflicted with deadly poison. Later on, 
                Inosuke lasted impressively long against the second-strongest Upper Rank demon, Doma, and endured 
                numerous attacks from him. During his battle with Muzan, he suffered a multitude of minor and severe 
                injuries but still persisted in order to defeat the Demon King and later fend off the transformed 
                Tanjiro.

            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Immense Strength: </strong>As suggested by his highly developed physique and use of Total 
                Concentration Breathing, Inosuke possesses superhuman physical strength, being able to dual-wield two 
                katanas as opposed to one, even swinging them with enough speed to create air slashes. During his battle 
                on Mount Natagumo, he was able to throw Tanjiro high into the air with ease. In Rehabilitation 
                Training, he easily holds Aoi by her legs and lifts three rocks bigger than his torso with ropes. He 
                could punch through the Mugen Train's roof immediately upon waking up, slice up the parts of Lower One 
                Enmu's body that had engulfed the train's cabins, and easily cut through the roof and floor of the 
                locomotive. In his pursuit of Daki's obi in the Ogimoto House, he incidentally punched a patron's 
                face into the wall, knocking him out and leaving a large hole in the concrete. During Hasira 
                Training, he even managed to move a boulder nearly twice his size with his bare hands. He was even 
                able to damage parts of Doma's body with his slashes and throw his swords with such strength that the force 
                on impact was enough to drive Kanao's sword through his neck, although Doma's durability was severely 
                hampered.

            </figure>
            <ul class="fixlist">
               <li>
                  <strong>Enhanced Touch: </strong>After growing up in the mountains, Inosuke developed a sharp and 
                  incredibly sensitive sense of touch. His skin can even feel the small vibrations in the air. 
                  Inosuke incorporated this ability into his <strong>Spatial Awareness </strong>technique, where 
                  he uses his acute sense of touch to locate all the demons spread out across a giant mountain 
                  and later uses it to detect the location of the Father of the Spider Family. By using this 
                  ability, he can tell if anyone is looking at him, especially if they have any hostile intentions. 
                  He can even pinpoint the exact location they are looking at, which gives him an edge in combat. 
                  His sensitive skin also gave him an edge against Doma, as his sense of touch naturally steered 
                  him away from inhaling his dangerous frost.
               </li>
               <li>
                 <strong>Extrasensory Perception: </strong>Inosuke's senses are honed to such extremes that he 
                 possesses a form of extrasensory perception that allows him to detect things outside the normal 
                 range of perception. Inosuke can sense how serious his opponents are, as seen when he sensed 
                 that Daki's sash attacks were relaxing a little bit, which gave him an opening to attack, and 
                 how strong Akaza and Kyojuro Rengoku were. He was also able to sense a person's malice and 
                 intent to kill even when they were outside his range of sight, which prevented him from getting 
                 killed by Gyutaro's scythe attack. Inosuke was also able to sense that Daki's obi had living 
                 people trapped inside it, which prevented him from accidentilly harming them when fighting.

           <hr>
           <p>
                <strong>Master Swordsman: </strong>Inosuke has displayed exemplary skill in dual wielding his 
                Nichirin katanas, allowing him to take on and defeat demons on various occasions, even enabling him 
                to match members of the Twelve Kizuki. During the events within the Infinity Castle, Inosuke has 
                undeniably polished his swordsmanship skills to the level of a Hashira, allowing him to keep up and 
                go toe-to-toe with Upper Rank Two, Doma.

           <h3>Breathing Style</h3>
           <p>
                <strong>Beast Breathing: </strong>A Breathing Style distantly derived from Wind Breathing and the 
                personal creation of <strong>Inosuke Hashibara </strong>himself after living in the mountains and 
                fighting for survival. It also seems to take inspiration from the wild boars that he grew up with.
           </p>
           <br>
           <h3>Techniques</h3>
           <ol class="fixlist">
                <li>
                    <strong>First Fang: Pierce </strong>- The user stabs the target's neck with both blades.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Second Fang: Slice </strong>- The user unleashes a double slash with two blades in an 
                    X-shaped cut.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Third Fang: Devour </strong>- The user releases simultaneous horizontal slashes towards 
                    the target's throat to decapitate them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fourth Fang: Slice 'n Dice </strong>- The user delivers multiple diagonal double slashes 
                    with both swords.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fifth Fang: Crazy Cutting </strong>- The user slices everything in all directions while 
                    in mid-air.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sixth Fang: Palisade Bite </strong>- The user releases simultaneous slashes with two 
                    swords from both directions in a saw-like movement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Seventh Form: Spatial Awareness </strong>- The user utilizes their sense of touch to 
                    identify the position of enemies and their weaknesses by feeling small disturbances in the air. 
                    This technique was so strong that <strong>Inosuke Hashibira </strong>could sense all the demons 
                    spread out through a whole mountain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Eighth Form: Explosive Rush </strong>- The user charges towards their opponent at 
                    blinding speeds, ignoring all incoming attacks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ninth Fang: Extending Bendy Slash </strong>- The user dislocates the joints of their arm 
                    to increase the range of their attack, then unleashes a fast, swinging forward strike.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tenth Fang: Whirling Fangs </strong>- The user rapidly spins their swords in a 
                    circular motion, deflecting enemy attacks such as projectiles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sudden Throwing Strike </strong>- The user throws both of their blades in a spinning 
                    motion at the enemy.
                </li>
           </ol>

           <hr>
           <p>
                <strong>Dual Serrated Nichirin Katanas: </strong>Unlike most Demon Slayers, Inosuke wields two 
                Nichirin katanas. They are chipped with numerous gashes within the blade's edge, allowing the 
                swords to rip and tear flesh rather than cause a clean slice, which he prefers. His dual katanas 
                are indigo-gray in color. Inosuke's katanas don't have a tsuba; rather, he wraps the hilt of the 
                katana in cloth. He also dosen't possess a sword sheath and also uses cloth to tie his katanas 
                at either side of his waist.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
                Inosuke breaks his katana twice throughout the course of the series: once during his battle against 
                Father of the Spider Family and when he failed to slice through his skin, and again during the 
                final battle against Muzan.
